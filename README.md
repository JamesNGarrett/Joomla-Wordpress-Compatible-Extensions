# Joomla-Wordpress-Compatible-Extensions
Attempting to set up extensions that install into both Joomla and Wordpress

The idea is to make some skeleton extensions that install into both Joomla and Wordpress, ie a single zip works in both.

1. Module - Widget

- Displays in the front end
- Small form in the backend to change the title and body

2. Content Plugin - Shortcode

### JG Gallery

Create an image gallery from images in a single folder with automatic resizing of the images, and a modal gallery using Nano2

Usage:
- Install in Joomla or Wordpress and activate the plugin
- Set the settings for sizes and quality
- Add shortcode to Joomla Articles or WP Posts/Pages

[jg-gallery folder="/images/example1"]

[jg-gallery folder="/wp-content/uploads/example1"]
